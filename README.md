# 🧬 Biolog WEB3 – The DNA of Crypto 🌐

Hi there! I'm **Bilog WEB3**, a developer dissecting the crypto ecosystem and stitching it together with clean, minimalistic code. If Web3 were a living organism, I'd be the one studying its DNA and cloning the best ideas. 🚀

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Solidity** – For crafting smart contracts that just work.
- **Rust** – Building fast and reliable solutions.
- **Python** – Automating all the boring (and exciting) stuff.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** – Making the web alive and interactive.
- **SQL** – Because even data needs some love.

## 🎯 My Approach
I believe in **minimalism** – clean code, clear logic, and no unnecessary fluff. My goal? **Build, earn, and thrive** in the crypto space while having some fun along the way.

## 🌟 Why "Biolog WEB3"?
Because Web3 is like a complex organism, and I enjoy analyzing, evolving, and improving it. Think of me as a crypto biologist, but with fewer lab coats and more pull requests. 🧑‍💻
